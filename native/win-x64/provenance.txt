Cross-compiled using mingw-w64-gcc on Arch Linux.

(The advantage of doing this is the resulting .dll only relies on
"msvcrt.dll", the version of the C runtime baked into all modern
versions of Windows - so there shouldn't be a need to install a specific
Visual C++ Runtime to use the DLL.

The downside is that MinGW isn't known to be the most stable compiler.
Shout if it doesn't work. Hopefully it does.)
